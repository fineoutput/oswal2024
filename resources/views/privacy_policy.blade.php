            If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain the content of your email messages together with your email address and our responses. We provide the same level of protection for electronic communications as we do for information received by mail and telephone.

            <h2>Communication with You:</h2>
            <br><br>
            Registration or correspondence with us via email constitutes a commercial relationship and implies consent for us to communicate with you regarding our services. We promise to only send you information deemed relevant to our commercial relationship and any email communication you may receive from us highlighting our services, special offers or promotions will include an opt out or unsubscribe feature.
            <br><br>
            <h2>Website use details:</h2>
            <br><br>
            Similar to other commercial websites, our website utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" and web server log files to collect information about how our website is used. Information gathered through cookies and web server logs may include the date and time of your visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our website, and the website visited just before and just after our website.

            <h2>Saving of collected information:</h2>
            <br><br>
            The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers) on our website, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). When credit card details are collected, we simply pass them on in order to be processed as required. We never permanently store complete credit card details.
            <br><br>
            We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

            <h2>How we use your information provided by you to us?</h2>
            <br><br>
            We use personal information for purposes of administering our business activities, provision of services, monitoring the use of services, marketing and promotional efforts, improvement of our content and service offerings, and customization of our website's content, layout, services and other lawful purposes. These activities improve our website and enable us to better tailor it to meet your needs.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, such information may be shared with others on an aggregate basis. Personally identifiable information or business information will not be shared with parties except as required by law.

            <h2>How we use information collected by cookies?</h2>
            <br><br>
            As you visit and browse our website, the website uses cookies to differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from having to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our web server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our website and which parts of the website are most popular. This helps us gather feedback to constantly improve our website and better serve our clients. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not intentionally store any personal information that your browser provides us in your cookies.
            <br><br>
            <h2>IP addresses</h2>
            <br><br>
            Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data known as traffic data so that data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to you.
            <br><br>
            <h2>Information sharing</h2>
            <br><br>
            We do not share, sell, lend or lease any of the information that uniquely identify a subscriber (such as email addresses or personal details) with anyone except to the extent it is necessary to process transactions or provide services that you have requested.
            <br><br>
            <h2>Legally Compelled disclosure of information</h2>
            <br><br>
            We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights. We may also disclose account information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service or to protect the safety of our users and the Public.
            <br><br>
            <h2>Other websites connected to our website</h2>

            We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites connected to or from our web site or the information or content contained therein. Often links to other websites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our website. Please remember that when you use a link to go from our website to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect.

            <br><br>
